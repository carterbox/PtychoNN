# PtychoNN: Deep learning of ptychographic imaging

PtychoNN is a two-headed encoder-decoder network that simultaneously predicts
sample amplitude and phase from input diffraction data alone. PtychoNN is 100s
of times faster than iterative phase retrieval and can work with as little as
**25X less data.**

The strucuture of the network is shown below:
